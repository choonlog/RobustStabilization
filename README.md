# RobustStabilization
RobustStabilization is a Python package that determines robust stabilizing control inputs of perturbed biological networks via coordinate transformation and algebraic analysis. Since cells have heterogenous characteristics, it is very challenging to control it with the common control inputs at once. In particular, in the case of cancer cells, it is difficult to apply targeted therapy because each tumor population with various mutation profiles can arise during cancer development. RobustStabilization is an algorithm implemented in python that finds appropriate common control inputs in multiple mutated networks with various mutation profiles. A relevant paper will be soon published.
